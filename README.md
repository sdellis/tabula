## About tabula

Why on earth do we need another slideshow app?

Anyone who has read Edward Tufte's polemic on [The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_pp) understands the limitations of what the medium when it comes to instruction.  The long-term goal with _tabula_ is to enable as much data as possible to come through the "slide" interface, in contrast to a handful of bullet points.  _Tabula_ should highlight evidence to back up the claims of the presenter.  Since we are so accustomed to a marketing pitch approach to presentations, a leap of imagination is necessary to see how deep zooming on images and charts, real-time collaborative annotations, comparisons and overlays, automatic citations and other enhancements that using IIIF allow will only make for a stronger teaching instrument.  More substance, less fluff.

In short, _tabula_ aims for a more empirical approach to presentations.  Empiricism is all about evidence-based understanding, that we have no a priori knowledge and all learning happens through experience/experiments.  The notion of _tabula rasa_ ("clean state" or "blank tablet") connotes a view of mind as originally blank, on which experience leaves marks.  This notion is the basis of Empiricism and ultimately, the scientific method.

The name _tabula_ (latin for slate or tablet) was selected as a "namespace" for a suite of similar applications because it is a tablet with many possibilities.  At the moment, it's vaporware.  But one could imagine "rasa", the core library of tabula, serving as the foundation of a few other types of future tools that may only require a few additional libraries and plugins to better fit their particular contexts.  The instructional slideshow might be called _tabula eruditio_ (learning tablet) while a musical "fakebook", for formatting and sharing sheet music, chords, and lyrics, might be called _tabula musica_.
